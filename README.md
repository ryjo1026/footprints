# Install and Launch

You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

In the terminal, move into the top level directory of this project (containing package.json) and run:
```
npm install
```
After this command finishes running, run (also in the terminal):
```
npm start
```
This will compile the javascript code into the build folder and serve the built project from `http://localhost:9000` on the computer.
